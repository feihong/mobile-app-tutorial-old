title: Requirements
---

You will need the following things before starting this tutorial:

- An Android phone that can run Android OS 5.1+. Any feature phone made in or after 2012 should work. A tablet would probably also work, provided it has a camera.
- A computer capable of running the [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser (Firefox supposedly works, but we think Chrome works better)
- [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup) (you'll use this to sign in to your App Inventor account)
- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) account (this is a free service that allows you to set up the server software that we use during this tutorial)

Once you have all your accounts set up, go to the [installation instructions](../installation).

If you don't have a compatible Android device, don't despair! You can also develop entirely on your computer, using an emulator. Please see the [emulator installation instructions](../emulator-installation).
