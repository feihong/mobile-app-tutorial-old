You only need to install one app on your Android device. Use the Google Play app to download and install [MIT AI2 Companion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3&hl=en). If your phone doesn't have Google Play, go to [this page](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-wifi.html) and download the APK file directly.

That's it! You're ready to [start creating your first mobile app](../the-basics).
