title: Turn autoplay off on YouTube
---

When you're on the YouTube website, go to a video page (for example, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz5FVfCF9uQ)) and then look for this interface item somewhere on the right side of the page:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/autoplay/autoplay-on.png)

Click the blue toggle button so that it looks like this:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/autoplay/autoplay-off.png)

With Autoplay disabled, you don't have to worry about another video automatically playing right after you've watched the current video.
