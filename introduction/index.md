"There should be an app for that." Have you ever thought that? Have you ever imagined how cool it would be to build your own app? Well, you've come to the right place!

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create mobile apps using a free tool called [MIT App Inventor](http://www.appinventor.org). Unlike other programming environments, App Inventor runs within your browser and doesn't require you to learn a programming language. All you need is a computer and an Android phone.

Throughout this tutorial you will learn to build a [puzzle hunt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzlehunt) app. Your completed puzzle hunt app will showcase your creativity, impress your family, and entertain your friends!
